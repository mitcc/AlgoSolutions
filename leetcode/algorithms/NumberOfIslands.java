/*
 * Given a 2d grid map of '1's (land) and '0's (water), 
 * count the number of islands. An island is surrounded 
 * by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands 
 * horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four 
 * edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 11110
 * 11010
 * 11000
 * 00000
 * Answer: 1
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 11000
 * 11000
 * 00100
 * 00011
 * Answer: 3
